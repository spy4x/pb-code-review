          <p>
            In this document I'm going to share with you my recommendations
            regarding codebase of
            REST API.
          </p>

          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <p>
            API users, such as iOS developers complain about bugs, which appear
            at API side pretty frequently.
            Features, which worked previously stop working after something was
            changed in another part of codebase.
            That says that codebase isn't solid and has some amount of issues.

          <p>
            I need to tell that I reviewed mostly code itself and not the
            infrastructure, like Amazon Web Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of things, that could be reviewed and probably I'll
            do detailed review
            for other parts of the application. But for now let's dive deeper in
            what could be improved in the code and what have to be improved.

        What does developer see first when he joins new team and going to work
        on
        codebase?
        Right, the repo. And it could say a lot about how team manages
        development.
        Things like readme, branch management, commit message convention are
        important. And let me tell you why.

        management</a></h3>

      <p>
        When you work in a team it's very important to keep branch list clear.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h4 class="text-center">

            Main branch is <code>28MAR</code>. Name is not obvious.
            It has not been updated since 2017-03-15.
          </p>
          <p>
            Active branch is <code>*****-dynamodb-migration</code> and
            from this moment I've felt that something is wrong with the
            codebase.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h4 class="text-center">

          </h4>
          <p>
            <code>master</code> branch is the main one. In most cases this
            branch
            stores code that is in production. It should be stable and secured
            from altering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developers could create feature-based branches and once feature is
            implemented and tested
            - this branch should be merged into the <code>master</code> branch.
          </p>

          <p>
            What are you talking about and why is it so important?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, all things, that I'm going to mention in this report work
            together and depend on each other.
            Correct branching management allows devs to configure Continuous
            Integration(CI) and Continuous Deployment(CD).
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>Continuous Integration</code> basically just means that the
            developer's working copies are synchronized with a shared mainline
            several times a day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>Continuous Deployment</code> is described as the logical next
            step after continuous integration: Automatically deploy the product
            into production whenever it passes QA!
          </p>

          <p>
            So... code should be deployed to production as frequent as possible.
            And it happens when developer merges his feature-based branch to the
            <code>master</code> branch.
          </p>
          <p>That's it. Small thing, but important one.</p>

      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>
        Code quality is pretty low.
        It’s obvious that code was written by several developers in the past and
        current version still uses some of old code without proper adaptation of
        it. Also it looks like code was written in hurry by junior/middle
        developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To allow developers to breath easier and product owners to get stable
        application I recommend to do next things:
      </p>


      <h3>Remove unused code</h3>
      <p>
        Right now there are a lot of code in the repo, that’s not used anymore.
        I calculated that about 70% of code is not used.
        Some code looks like it doesn’t belong to this project at all.
        That could be that when application was scaffolded -
        somebody copied his previous project and started to write code for this
        project
        over that old code.
      </p>

      <h3>Refactor everything</h3>
      <p>
        There is a mess between v1 &amp; v2 versions in code.
        iOS app has to call some endpoints from v1 and some from v2, that
        doesn’t make sense
        for new app that doesn't have to support legacy version of API.
      </p>

      <h3>Follow style guides and best practices</h3>
      <p>
        ESLint could be used to validate code.
        It's automatic tool, that runs before every commit and prevents bad code
        to appear in the repo.
        That will save time of future improvements and feature implementations,
        reduce amount of bugs.
      </p>

      <h3>Start using typed JavaScript - TypeScript or Flow</h3>
      <p>
        That reduces amount of runtime errors helping developer to catch a bug
        as compile stage,
        before pushing app to production server. Must-have for apps that are
        going to evolve.
      </p>

      <h3>Start using Test-Driven Development (TDD, automated testing)</h3>
      <p>
        That’s the most important point in this list.
        TDD - it's when test is written before implementation of the feature.
        Without previous features covered by tests it’s harder to go forward or
        improve feature without breaking something that already worked.
        Must-have thing.
      </p>
